MEL IS A NOOB

09/20/2015
Realized some of the .NET framework libraries are not in java so the SQL utility class
will not be as complete in Java as what we've done before in C#. The basic MySQLUtilities
class is complete and is uploaded to Oakland.

Added SRS to the GitHUB. This will be annoying because Google Drive does not format this well.
Mel would love to move the SRS to OneDrive for easier Word Formatting. The cascading numbering
system on the SRS is good to go. Just need to copy the level that you want to paste and put it in
The numbers will automatically update. The original copies of the SRS documents that I could find
do not do a good job on this.

Trying to finalize all tables by tonight.

Realized that it was Oakland's Network preventing issues, the 3 hours of
troubleshooting and creating the database in different ways was no use,
but Anthony checked at his Oakland apartment and it was fine.

Continue the conversion and replacement of methods in order. Mel has done
alot of database stuff in C# and SQL Server but syntax and ways to connect
are different in Java and MySQL.

Continued to research how to connect to the Amazon MySQL DB. Hopefully
we can figure out a way. Mel has a VPN he can use to bypass oakland stuff.

Question is if there is a place to get a server on Oakland's campus.

Created AWS Account
Trying to figure out how to connect to the database.
sg-2c6cee48 ip allowed removed, allow all traffic, did not work.
Deleted the AWS default VPC account on Amazon West Oregon, should not have done that
Switch Port numbers on AWS

Setup MySQL on Mel's server, works if needed as a backup

Created the template for the SRS
