Realized some of the .NET framework libraries are not in java so the SQL utility class
will not be as complete in Java as what we've done before in C#. The basic MySQLUtilities
class is complete and is uploaded to Oakland.

Trying to finalize all tables by tonight.

Realized that it was Oakland's Network preventing issues, the 3 hours of
troubleshooting and creating the database in different ways was no use,
but Anthony checked at his Oakland apartment and it was fine.

Continue the conversion and replacement of methods in order. Mel has done
alot of database stuff in C# and SQL Server but syntax and ways to connect
are different in Java and MySQL.

Continued to research how to connect to the Amazon MySQL DB. Hopefully
we can figure out a way. Mel has a VPN he can use to bypass oakland stuff.

Question is if there is a place to get a server on Oakland's campus.
